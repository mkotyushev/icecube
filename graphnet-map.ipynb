DynEdge is a GNN implemented in GraphNeT - it represents IceCube events as 3D point clouds and leverages techniques from segmentation analysis in computer vision to reconstruct events. You can find technical details on the model in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/17/11/P11003). The model and training configuration shown below is nearly identical to what's presented in the paper. Note that this configuration was originally meant for low energy, so it's possible that some adjustments might improve performance."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%load_ext autoreload\n","%autoreload 2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib inline"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-03T08:35:50.269123Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-03T08:35:50.268509Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-03T08:35:51.121812Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-03T08:35:51.120342Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-03T08:35:50.269085Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[1;34mgraphnet\u001b[0m: \u001b[32mINFO    \u001b[0m 2023-03-01 12:08:05 - get_logger - Writing log to \u001b[1mlogs/graphnet_20230301-120805.log\u001b[0m\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/root/miniconda3/envs/graphnet/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tqdm/auto.py:22: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found.
