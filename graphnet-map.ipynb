DynEdge is a GNN implemented in GraphNeT - it represents IceCube events as 3D point clouds and leverages techniques from segmentation analysis in computer vision to reconstruct events. You can find technical details on the model in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/17/11/P11003). The model and training configuration shown below is nearly identical to what's presented in the paper.
